# Problem Ratings for Codeforces

[Codeforces](codeforces.com) is a well-known community for algorithms competitions. There are several heuristics that exist for finding suitable practice problems on Codeforces (sorting by the total number of solvers, for example), but none of them perform well and consistently in practice. We decided to create a better measure of problem difficulty, which we’ll call “problem rating”. You can read more about problem rating on our blog post [here].
